Challenges:
(before development)
Authentication and authorization will likely be the most challenging. When a feature like responsive design is implemented incorrectly, it's abundantly clear. It may be harder to tell if an authentication system is sufficiently secure.
(after development)

Problem Solved/Target Audience:
Purely an educational exercise, the app has no realistic utility and no users in mind.  It's being deployed for the sake of learning deployment.

Scope:
The scope of the project is intentionally small to refine a development process and quickly see a project through from planning to deployment.
